            Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a
            newly discovered coronavirus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to
            moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>HOW IT SPREADS</p>
          <p>
            The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through
            droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or
            exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and
            quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within
            close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a
            contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.

            <li>Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
            <li>
              Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when
              you cough or sneeze.
            </li>
            <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>

          <p>
            If you feel sick you should rest, drink plenty of fluid, and eat
            nutritious food. Stay in a separate room from other family members,
            and use a dedicated bathroom if possible. Clean and disinfect
            frequently touched surfaces.
          </p>

            Everyone should keep a healthy lifestyle at home. Maintain a healthy
            diet, sleep, stay active, and make social contact with loved ones
            through the phone or internet. Children need extra love and
            attention from adults during difficult times. Keep to regular
            routines and schedules as much as possible.
